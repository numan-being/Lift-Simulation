<h1>Lift Simulator App</h1>
This is a lift simulator app that allows you to simulate the operation of a lift system in a building. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<h3>Features</h3>
The app allows you to:

Enter the number of floors in the building and the number of lifts in the system.
View the current status of each lift, including its current floor and direction of travel.
Select a floor from which to call a lift.
Watch the lifts move between floors as they respond to calls.

<h3>How to Use</h3>
To use the app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will be prompted to enter the number of floors and lifts in the building.

Once you have entered the required information, you can select a floor from which to call a lift by clicking on one of the floor buttons on the screen. The app will then simulate the operation of the lifts as they respond to the call and move between floors.

<h3>Development</h3>
To modify the app or contribute to its development, you can clone the project from GitHub and make changes to the source code. The app is built using vanilla JavaScript, so there are no external dependencies or build tools required.

<h3>Credits</h3>
The lift simulator app was created as a project task for Real-dev-Squad.
